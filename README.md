# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a foundational study guide for my personal use as I prepare to begin the coding bootcamp! The motivation and purpose of this project is to set myself up for success in this program by providing myself with a space where I can review my materials I am learning each week. While working on this project, I learned all sorts of new information on the topics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I look forward to using this study guide as I continue to build my coding knowledge on top of this prework foundation.
